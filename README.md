# House Prices EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Welcome to the House Prices EDA project repository. This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis on house prices with a primary focus on the Sale Price variable. The goal is to gain valuable insights into the housing market, understand trends, and identify key factors influencing sale prices.

## Project Overview

- **Topic**: House Prices EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- **Primary Variable**: Sale Price

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Train dataset, which contains information about the real state industry (House Prices).

## Files

- `train.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `House Prices EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Key Findings

- **Sale Price Distribution**: The Sale Price variable exhibits a right-skewed distribution with a skewness of 1.88 and a kurtosis of 6.54. This indicates the presence of both lower and higher-priced properties, with potential outliers.

- **Sale Price Trends Over Time**: A time-series analysis revealed a decreasing trend in median house prices over the years. Notably, there was an increasing pattern between 2006 and 2007, followed by a continuous decrease, reaching its lowest point in 2010.

- **Numerical Variable Correlations**: Key numerical variables, including Overall Quality, Living Area (ft2), Garage Space (Car #), Year Built, and Basement Area (ft2), were analyzed for their correlations with Sale Price. Notable findings include the high correlation between Sale Price and Overall Quality, as well as the positive correlation between Living Area and Sale Price.

- **Categorical Variable Impacts**: Several categorical variables were identified as having a significant impact on Sale Price. These include Zoning Classification, Road Access Type, Utilities Type, Neighborhoods, Dwelling Type, Roof Material, Exterior Covering, Material Quality, Foundation Type, Basement Height, Basement Rating, Heating Type, and more.
